                    I am a web-developer and recent computer science graduate. I want to help businesses come to life with code and join a team that solves a relevant problem because convenience is key to enjoying life. I want this world to be a happy and comfortable place to live in and I believe these problems we solve will contribute greatly to my goalâ€¦and I just genuinely love to code, it feels like a fun puzzle solving game to me.

                    Previously, I was part of a software engineering immersive program called General Assembly, where I learned full stack web development using react frontend with nodeJS using express and MongoDB. From there I carried on to pursue a bachelors in computer science in CSI. In the future, I would like to look for a team that is passionate about taking real world problems and solving them with code to bring a solution that will help many.
